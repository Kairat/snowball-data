voc.txt was mostly generated from a dump of the Estonian wikipedia by the
script wikipedia-most-common-words like so:

WikiExtractor.py etwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2
cat text/*/* | ./wikipedia-most-common-words 32 latin > voc.txt

The dump used was dated September 1st 2023.

It was supplemented with 751 additional words from a handmade test list
submitted by Linda Freienthal.

output.txt was generated from voc.txt by running it through the stemmer:

stemwords -l estonian -c UTF_8 -i estonian/voc.txt -o estonian/output.txt
